# Eukaryotic-Whole-Genome-Assembly-and-Annotation-Workflow
This repository documents a bioinformatic workflow for the de novo assembly and annotation of a eukaryotic genome with a minimum reference. The workflow utilizes various open-source tools to process Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data, perform assembly and polishing, and ultimately annotate the assembled genome.
